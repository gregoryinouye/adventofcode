 * --- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---
 * The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the
 * dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.
 *
 * Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required
 * wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. The
 * elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of
 * slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
 * A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of
 * slack, for a total of 43 square feet.
 * All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was 1588178.
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length
 * they need to order, which they would again like to be exact.
 *
 * The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one
 * face. Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is
 * equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2+2+3+3 = 10 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 2*3*4 = 24 feet of
 * ribbon for the bow, for a total of 34 feet.
 * A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 1+1+1+1 = 4 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 1*1*10 = 10 feet of
 * ribbon for the bow, for a total of 14 feet.
 * How many total feet of ribbon should they order?
 *
 * Your puzzle answer was 3783758.
